class AbstractShrewdModel(models.Model):
    '''
    Abstract model for objects under shrewd (and shrewd-ish) management.

    __ROW-LEVEL MANAGEMENT:__
    Objects of (models subclassed from) this model have two mutually exclusive
    resting places in their lifetime -- one is the recycle bin, the other is
    the yet-to-be-named, default resting place :).

    So there's the idea of objects which are in the recycle bin, and
    objects which are not in the recycle bin.

    Two operations, DELETE and RESTORE, are available on these objects. The
    operations act according to the resting place of the particular object, but
    basically:
    * DELETE sends an object to the recycle bin -- soft deletion, if you may.
    * RESTORE takes an object out of the recycle bin.

    For more on the nuances of these operations, read the
    documentation for their related methods, `delete` and `restore`.

    __TABLE-WIDE MANAGEMENT:__
    * Shrewd by default (via an instance of `ShrewdManager`).
    * Default manager manages only objects of the model which are not in the
    recycle bin.
